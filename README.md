Puzzle Challenge
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program starts with 16 puzzle pieces and randomly selects a staring piece.
After the starting piece is selected, it will find the next pieces required to finish the puzzle.
If no solution can be found with the current pieces, it will remove the last piece and try a new one in its place.
It can also rotate pieces to use them in different ways if needed. 

This project was done in Unreal Engine.
